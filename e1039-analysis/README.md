# e1039-analysis

A repository to share all user-level analysis programs at E1039.


## Short-Term Usage

You can add your program to this repository at any time.
It is probably easier for everyone to share your/others' programs here, rather than using your personal repository.
You could remove your program at any time later if you want.


## Long-Term Usage

It is preferable that you keep your program in this repository even after you finish using it.
It will be reused by you and others.

Once you decide to do so, you are recommended to tidy up your program as follows:
* Add `README.md` to explain the purpose and the usage of your program.
* Provide your name (in `README.md`) so that one can send you questions/requests.
* Remove extra files/lines.
