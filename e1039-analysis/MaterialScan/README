How to use:
start root and
Run the Fun4All_G4_sPHENIX.C (or fsPHENIX or ePHENIX) macro with -1 events 
(which just loads the G4 configuration)

.x Fun4All_G4_sPHENIX.C(-1)

Load the matscan.C macro

.L matscan.C

and set the theta/phi ranges and number of bins you want with

set_phimin() // in degrees
set_phispan() // in degrees, phi range is phimin - phimin+phispan
set_phibins() // number of bins in this phi range

same for theta. For scans in phi use theta_span = theta_min and theta_bins = 1

if you are running the same ranges all the time, just adjust those values in 
the macro.
Execute matscan() and store output in some file (here T.T)

matscan(); > T.T

Sadly this dumps more than just the x0/lamda values for each phi/theta bin.
In order to extract those, quit root and run matscan_digest.pl to extract 
x0/lamda0 for each phi/theta bin:

perl matscan_digest.pl T.T

This will create a file matscan.dat. 
plot_matscan.C is a simple plotting macro which plots x0/lamda vs phi (leave
theta constant by theta_span = theta_min and theta_bins = 1:

.x plot_matscan.C("matscan.dat")
